    "### What is the motivation behind their creation?\n",
    "Programmers need a platform, where they can keep their codes, organize projects and distribute and update source codes easily. Tracking of code changes and thus software versions, as well as the speed and transparency of all these operations are also desired features and essential aspects of software developmen. Based on the available functionalities, software that fulfill the latter criteria are referred to as _\"version-control systems (VCS)\"_ or _\"source-control management (SCM) systems\"_. Deploying these software on a remote server that is connected to the internet can be used for everything detailed above. If you're trying to write any code during your career, you'll definitely need to use a software like this in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development on systems like these are fairly straightforward. The main code base is stored on a server, where every developer of the project have access to it. Developers download this code base to their own machines and keep working on that on their own. Now there is a serious problem that should be addressed in any workflow like this (maybe it's not even limited solely to programming). We should always be aware of the fact that developers of a project are constantly changing the same code base in parallel. These \"branching\" or parallel development states are called as _development branches_ or _forks_ of a software. Developers working on different branches are modifying the same parts of the code a lot of times or developing parts in parallel that are incompatible with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To somehow address these arising _code conflicts_ or _merge conflicts_, you need a system that can handle or _makes it possible to handle_ all these different error sources that are emerge from multiple people working on the same thing simultaneously. These \"systems\" or software that are capable of doing so are the version control systems.\n",

    "Starting in 1998 until 2005, the development of Linux took place on a version control system called [BitKeeper](https://www.bitkeeper.org/). In 2005 BitKeeper decided to stop providing free versions of its client, forcing its users to either charge for a BitKeeper license or switch to another version-control system. In response the development of _git_, a new system was commenced by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. His goal was to create a version-control system that suits all the needs of Linux development and provide features that do not exist in freely available systems. Oh and of course, it had to be faster, than any available version-control systems that time. Two weeks after he started the project, the very first version made it's public debut. Since then, _git_ became the largest and most popular version control system of our time.\n",

    "Free of charge online hosting providers for code development, implementing _git_'s and their own functionalities are essential in modern programming. On sites like these, users can register for free and access codes through the websites themselves or via a command line interface (CLI). These websites usually provide additional features and storage for paying users, but the most important features are (again, usually) available for free. Since GitHub is the most popular online platform for this, this guide will focus on that in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind teaching about _git_ and GitHub is that these two are deeply intertwine the modern programming community, just as eg. StackOverflow does. If you're working as a \"programmer\" or more like doing any kind of work that is related to programming, you're bound to use _git_ and GitHub in most part of your career. The overwhelming majority of important (open source) software development takes place on GitHub and sometimes on other websites that you can interact with using _git_ (eg. GitLab, Bitbucket etc.). If someone wants to work on any project like this, they obviously have to use _git_ and GitHub. But companies are also using mostly _git_ in their private networks to manage their codebase. GitHub is also great to serve as a _portfolio_ for someone who wants to make a career with their programming skills. It's a perfect platform, where people can showcase their (hopefully better) codes tto the world. If you're working on some code from more, than 1 computer, then _git_ and GitHub is probably the easiest method to exchange code updates between the two computers. Even if someone works on a single computer, GitHub could serve as a completely free and virtually unlimited backup storage for their projects."

    "While there are some GUI software for _git_ on Windows, it's a command line utility at its core. That's why I'm using _git_ this way here. Here's a short guide how to install _git_ for Windows, MacOS or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the _git_ software\n",
    "    1. In the case of Windows, we usually install _Git bash_, a terminal emulator for Windows that is designed for the use of _git_  \n",
    "        >Install Git Bash from the [git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "    2. On Linux, MacOS or on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) we only need to install the _git_ software package using an available package manager\n",

    "        $ sudo [apt|pacman|yum|...] install git\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setup Git Bash with your \"credentials\". These are usually your username and/or your email address. In case of a closed project (eg. at a company), where the codes are stored on a private server, your \"credentials\" is usually just your username on that specific server. In case you're using _git_ to manage codes stored on GitHub/GitLab/etc. these are your username and email address that you registered with on these sites. Registering these \"credentials\" on a local device can be done by modifying the configuration of your _git_ installation from Git Bash (in case of Windows) or simply from the terminal (in case of Linux or WSL):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git config --global user.name  \"github-username\"\n",
    "$ git config --global user.email \"email@of-your-github.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. _(Optional)_ Other configuration options and first time installation tips can be found on the [git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setup your SSH connection and config.** Starting from 2020, GitHub is using SSH keys to authenticate users. This is a more secure way of authentication than HTTPS. If you're using _git_ for the first time, you probably don't have any SSH keys set up yet. But don't worry, we'll get to that later."

    "When you're connecting to a website over the internet, you're actually connecting to a _physical (web)server_, which stores the data of the website that is shown on your computer screen. Most parts of this process are handled by your browser. There are lot of cases however, when you need to connect to a server from a command line/terminal/shell. (Just an fyi: these three terms mean [completely different](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/) things, however they are often used interchangeably.)

Just like that, you can connect to servers from your command line/terminal/shell via eg. the _Secure Shell Protocol_ (SSH). These _secure protocols_ ensures that the any information exchanged between the server and the client (you) is encrypted. Of course, there were times when secure connection did not exist, neither in browsers nor command line interfaces. Now it's an essential standard if you're using computers in any way."

    "### III.2.  SSH and assymetric key-pairs\n",
    "Similarly to every \"protocol\" mentioned regarding computer science and technology (just like HTTPS above), SSH is also just a \"theoretical model\" or \"design\", which then should be implemented first by an actual software that can run on a computer. The most widely used implementation of SSH is the software called _OpenSSH_. Nowadays OpenSSH is not a single software, but rather a collection of software merged into a so-called _software suit_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of SSH is to provide its users to securely authenticate themselves, when they're trying to connect to a server _somehow_. However it's mostly used when a user wants to connect to a server via the command line. Its software implementation, OpenSSH provides several [authentication methods](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/openssh-authentication-methods-sshd-config/#OpenSSH_Authentication_Methods) (6 in total), like using a password, or an asymmetric key-pair. In the majority of the use-cases, key-pairs are the preferred authentication method. Besides giving us the comfort of not needing to type our passwords and still connecting securely to a machine<a href=#ft1>$^{[1]}$</a>, using asymmetric key-pairs are also considered to be a much more secure authentication method, than passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenSSH, this key-pair authentication method is based on the _asymmetric cryptography_ or _public-key cryptography_. This means that the authentication method uses a pair of keys: a _public key_, and a _private key_. The former is stored on the server's side, while the latter is on the client's (your) side. The purpose of the private key (held by you) is to authenticate yourself to the server (it's basically like showing your ID card). While on the other side the public key (on the server) is used to check whether your private key (your digital ID card) is valid or not. Of the story is much more complex than that. The _asymmetric cryptography_ itself refers to the practice of encrypting and decrypting messages using a unique, private-public key-pair, but that's a completely different topic for a completely different lecture.\n",

    "Asymmetric cryptography is designed in a way that as long as you're keeping your private key a secret (so read-only by you and only you), no potential impersonator can pretend to be you and then gaslight the server into this false idea. Since both the public key and the private key are simple text files stored on a computer, it is possible for someone to actually stole your private key (eg. copy the file after breaking into your account). To abridge this problem, the SSH protocol offers a second layer of protection by adding an optional _passphrase_ (a password essentially) to your asymmetric key pair that you need to type every time, when you try to connect to a server and authenticate yourself using the private key. Even if someone grab hold of your private key file, it's still useless without the (hopefully secure) passphrase.\n",

    "#### III.3.2.  Add an SSH key-pair to GitHub **(verbose)**\n",
    "A detailed and verbose tutorial is presented here just for the sake of clarity.\n",
    "##### **1.  Generating an SSH key-pair**\n",
    "1. Open Git Bash on Windows or any terminal on Linux.\n",
    "2. Create a `.ssh` directory in your `~` (home) directory, give the necessary permissions to it and `cd` into it. If you're on Windows, the `~` home directory is not the same as the `C:\\Users\\your-username` directory. The `~` home directory is the directory where you're (usually) placed at, when you start up your Git Bash. Even if that's not the case, you can just `cd` there using `cd ~`. But that's not even necessary for any of the command here if you them as-is.\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Just like the `.ssh` directory, the public and private keys, the SSH `config` file and other related files and folders need to be given the appropriate permissions for them to work as intended. A comprehensive list can be found in [this topic](https://superuser.com/questions/215504/permissions-on-private-key-in-ssh-folder). Here `700` stands for \"can be read, written and executed by only you\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the `ssh-keygen` software from OpenSSH to generate the key-pair. Several different cryptographic algorithms (like RSA or EdDSA etc.) can be used for key-pair generation, and most of them are implemented in OpenSSH. It's maybe not obvious, but some of the algorithms are more and some of them are less secure than the others. Generally it's advised to always use the safest available algorithm for key-generation. As of March, 2023, the best practice is to use the so-called `Ed25519` digital signature scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, how to use `ssh-keygen` to generate a key-pair? Besides telling `ssh-keygen` via a command line argument, which algorithm you want to use, you also need to pass your GitHub email address that you've used to register with. The command should look like this, where you obviously substitute the dummy email address with a real one linked to GitHub account:\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.com\"\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After hitting enter, `ssh-keygen` will ask you 3 questions. The first one is the following:\n",
    "    1. **Enter a filename to save the key in** (If the prompt is left empty, the default value is `~/.ssh/id_{name-of-the-algorithm}`)\n",
    "\n",
    "        This question asks you, where you want to save the key-pair and what do you want to name the created $2$ (public and private key) files. On a technical note, here you're actually asked to give an absolute OR a relative path to the files you want to create. Since we want to create them in the `.ssh` directory (and because we're `cd`-ed into it already in the previous step), both `~/.ssh/file-name` and `file-name` are correct answers here. (In the first case obviously the key-pair is generated with the file name `file-name` under the `~/.ssh/` directory, while in the second case, they're generated inside the current working directory, the directory you're currently `cd`-ed into (so, again, in `~/.ssh/`, since we're there currently).)\n",
    "   \n",
    "        It is a good practice though to name your key-pairs accordingly to what you want to use them for (which is to use them on GitHub in this case). For this first question, you can simply type something like `~/.ssh/id_github` or just `id_github`.\n",
    "    2. **Enter a passphrase!**\n",
    "    3. **Enter this passphrase again!**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   As it was already discussed, a passphrase is used to give an additional layer of protection to your key-pair (it's a password for the key-pair basically). Whether you want to give a passphrase to your key-pair or not is up to you. If you don't, just press enter two times to skip both questions. If you want to specify a passphrase, then keep in mind, that you have to type it every time, when you want to use your key-pair. For example, when you want to clone a repository from GitHub, you have to type in the passphrase every time you want to do so. This is a bit annoying, but it's a good practice to use a passphrase for your key-pair, since it makes it harder for an attacker to use your key-pair to access your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After you completed the previous steps, two messages about the successful creation of the `id_github` private key and the `id_github.pub` public key files will be displayed. Below that, the public key's SHA256 fingerprint and its randomart will be also printed. The fingerprint is a character chain randomly generated with the SHA256 hashing algorithm, using the public key as an input and it's used by the computer to validate an asymmetric key-pair more easily. Similarly, the randomart is a randomly generated ASCII art image that servers the same purpose, but for humans! A human can much more easily recognize a randomart image than a long character chain and can tell if it's the same as the one generated for the key-pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "   After you've finished with this setup, your terminal should look something like this:\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./img/ssh-keygen.png\"></img>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Register your key-pair in OpenSSH for your computer to be aware of its existence and for it to know on which server the key-pair has to be used. This can be done, by starting another software called `ssh-agent` **in the background**. It's slightly more tricky than starting it in the terminal itself. You have to use the following command for this:\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To assure that the generated public and private key-pair have the correct permissions, set them manually now:\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_github && chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_github.pub\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",

This indicates, that your SSH connection is well established between your device and GitHub and you're good to go.\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ ssh -T git@github.com\n",
    "> #The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.\n",
    "> #RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:(PUBLIC KEY FINGERPRING).\n",
    "> #Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? YES\n",
    "> #Hi (USERNAME)! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not\n",
    "> #provide shell access.\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Just some clarification for this command above. If you look it up, you'll find that the `-T` flag of `ssh` means that \"it disables pseudo-tty allocation\". Okay, what the hell does it mean? It consists of two parts: \n",
    "   - First of all, \"TTY\" simply means \"terminal\" and you can come across this acronym in many places if you're working with computers and command lines. It originates from the word _teletypewriter_, the \"father\" of the physical computer terminals and the \"grandfather\" of terminal emulators, so any \"terminal\" you run on your computer. Some well-known examples for the latter is eg. _PuTTY_ on Windows or _Terminal_, which was called as _Windows Terminal_ previously, but was renamed in February, 2022. _Terminal_ should also not be confused with _cmd.exe_ (the default command-line interpreter of Windows) or _PowerShell_.\n",
    "   - Second, the description of the `-T` flag in \"normal language\" means that this disables sending a terminal start-up request to the remote machine (which is otherwise sent by default). It's a very common and important practice that when you're doing an SSH connection test, you're always doing it so by passing this `-T` flag to the `ssh` command. The reason for this is that large majority of remote servers that people use with `ssh` for whatever reason are rejecting access to a remote terminal. If that's the case, then any `ssh` test without specifying the `-T` flag will be unsuccessful, the remote server will reject our `ssh` request and we'll be confused why our perfect `ssh` setup did not work.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In case of GitHub this is actually unnecessary, because while it actually tells us that \"...but GitHub does not provide shell access.\", it's still configured so to handle commands of careless users appropriately. Still, following good practices are always **very much advised**, because life won't be so kind to us when it comes to other servers."

    "1. If you're using numerous servers (just like people who work with computers do it every day), it can be tiresome to type full-length SSH commands every time you're trying to connect so a server. This can be shortened to single aliases using a correctly set up SSH `config` file.\n",
    "2. The  `ssh-agent` software that registers and handles your key-pairs is only activated, when you first run an `ssh` command after a reboot. This means that it needs some encouragement every time you turn on your computer for it to work properly. To diminish the inconvenience of adding keys to the `ssh-agent` every time you're restarting your device, you can define keys in the `config` file and configure them to be automatically added to the agent, no matter what.\n",

    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This file then can be edited with any text editor. The most important feature of this file is that you can collect every credential of a server that are otherwise should be typed explicitly into the command line every time, when you want to connect to the server. Instead of typing all these info, one can define an _alias_ for any _host_ (\"server\" in other words) inside the `config` file. When you wants to connect to a server now, you only have to specify the alias. Everything else is handled by OpenSSH.\n",

    "That's not really convenient to type it 54 times per day. Let's create an entry for that in the `config` file and even attach a private key to it that was previously configured for this server and my device. The entry would look like this:\n",

Eg. on your homepage you can click the \"+\" sign in the upper right corner of the page and then click on the **New repository** option:\n",

Some good examples for serious project READMEs can be found eg. [here](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/) or [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). **A repository should be always initialized with a README file**. So at least this checkbox should be always ticked.\n",
    "- `.gitignore` : _(Optional, but recommended)_ Tells _git_ what files or folders to ignore inside the repository. You can specify both file names and file extensions here with a very basic syntax. Every file that is created locally on a machine, but specified in the `.gitignore` will not be uploaded to the online, GitHub repository, when the user tells _git_ that \"okay, refresh and update the online repository with my changes and modifications\". It's useful to ignore temporary or cache files, or large data files. **The best practice is to upload only those files that are necessary for the project and are not automatically generated.** If you're working with eg. Jupyter Notebooks, C/C++ or TeX/LaTeX, **unnecessary files will be generated in every case**. You don't want to see them in you repository, so it's advised to ignore them using `.gitignore`. To lend us a helping hand, on GitHub there are lots of pre-built `.gitignore` files that you can select during repository creation from a drop-down menu.\n",
    "- `LICENSE` : _(Optional, but recommended)_ A specific digital license can be chosen for any project and automatically generated with your credentials for that specific repo. If you just collect your homework to a repo it doesn't matter, but if you're developing something more serious (even during your studies), then it's a nice to have. Usually for smaller projects the MIT license is recommended that you can select during repository creation on GitHub from a drop-down menu.\n",
